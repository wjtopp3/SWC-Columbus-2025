        "Create a text file and use Python’s hashlib library to generate a SHA-512 hash (longer! stronger!) of its contents (hint: use the same hashlib function but replace 256 with 512). Then perform an integrity check by recomputing the hash and comparing it to the original to detect if the file has been tampered with or corrupted.\n",
